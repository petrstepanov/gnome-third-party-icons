# GNOME Third Party App Icons
For those who create web application launchers via the Epiphany or Chromium browsers functionality. Their icons usually look pretty bad and do not follow with the official GNOME standards. In order for these application icons to look consistent on the Dock I have redesigned some of them.

Designed in Figma. Feel free to collaborate and suggest improvements!

## How to install
1. Checkout the repository and run `install.sh` in the Terminal.
2. Manually update the `.desktop` launchers in your `~/.local/share/applications/` to reflect the new icon.
