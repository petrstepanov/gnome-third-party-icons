# GNOME Third Party App Icons
Some application icons that are designed with respect to the GNOME icon standards. Icons will look prefectly lined up on the dock because their size corresponds to the default GNOME icon theme. All of the icons have a characteristic GNOME bottom shadow. Feel free to download, install and use.

Icons are designed in Figma. You are welcome to collaborate and suggest improvements!
