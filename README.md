# GNOME Third Party App Icons
I often create application launchers via the Epiphany or Chromium browsers functionality. Their icons usually look pretty bad and do not align with the official GNOME standards. Feel free to ask me to make an icon you want. I don't mind.

## How to install
1. Checkout the repository and run `install.sh` in the Terminal.
2. Manually update the `.desktop` launchers in your `~/.local/share/applications/` to reflect the new icon.
